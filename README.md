# Tic-Tac-Toe
Mod-1 Final Solo Project


# Abstract:

    For this project I built a Mortal Kombat themed Tik-Tac-Toe game. The user for this game can play with a partner and the apllication
  automatically will switch player turns based off a click on a tile. After a player wins, the opposing player who lost the round prior will now begin the next round.

# Installation Instructions:

  Steps in order to clone and run the app:

  1. Fork the GitHub Repository [file](https://github.com/cadechaney/Tic-Tac-Toe)
  2. After initializing git inside the directory the user wants they can now clone their forked copy to their machine
  3. Once cloned, the user can now cd into the directory, and using the 'open index.html' command in their terminal they can now open the application in their own browser.

# Context:

  This is my second solo project and final solo project of Mod1 at Turing. I spent approximately 25 hours total working on this project.

# Learning Goals:

  I used Javascript, CSS, and HTML. The goal of this project was to use everything I have learned throughout Mod 1 to effectively create my own application from the ground up. I created my application to have a seperation between the DOM and Data Model for the functionality of the page.

# Wins + Challenges:

Challenges: I struggled in the beginning on were to even start with my functionality. Once I caught some understanding of what needed to be done I was able to carry though with the Javascript.

Wins: I understand my use with CSS and HTML effectively. I also feel that my code after refactoring is very clean and DRY.
